- Permet de centraliser la recherche

- Offre une flexibilité incomparable

- La lecture des manuscripts est simplifiée/rendue plus rapide

### Le principal avantage

- _"Submissions are only accepted in Microsoft Word format"_... ne soyez plus **jamais** pris au dépourvu!

# Un (très) bref exemple

---
class: left, top

# Et la courbe d'apprentissage?

--

### Pour les débutants

- Plus simple que d'apprendre LaTeX

--

### Pour ceux qui connaissent LaTeX

- Simplement l'apprentissage d'un nouveau language, mais...

--

- ... les connaissances de LaTeX s'exportent dans Markdown...

--

- ... et la logique est similaire.

---
class: left, top

# Et les désavantages?

--

- La communauté est beaucoup plus petite

--

- Moins de _packages_ disponibles afin de polir l'esthétique des documents...

--

- ... donc il faut se salir les mains un peu!
